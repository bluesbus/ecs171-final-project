## DUMMY REVIEWS
reviews = [
    "I stumbled upon this hidden gem last night and had the most amazing dining experience. The atmosphere was cozy, the staff was friendly, and the food was a culinary masterpiece. I highly recommend the chef's special â€“ a true delight for your taste buds!",
    
    "This restaurant is a decent option if you're looking for a quick bite. The service was prompt, and the menu had a variety of options. The prices were reasonable, but don't expect anything extraordinary. It's a convenient choice for a casual meal.",
    
    "From the moment we walked in, the staff made us feel welcome. The chef's recommendations were spot-on, and each dish was a culinary delight. The attention to detail and unique flavors set this restaurant apart. We left with happy taste buds!",
    
    "I can't understand the hype around this place. The prices are exorbitant for the quality of food served. I ordered a dish that was supposed to be a specialty, but it was bland and lacked the promised flavors. Also the bathrooms were very dirty.Definitely not worth the money.",
    
    "The restaurant had a nice ambiance, and the service was courteous. The food, however, was average. Nothing stood out, but nothing was terrible either. If you're in the neighborhood and need a meal, it's an okay choice, but I wouldn't go out of my way to dine here.",
    
    "I'm thrilled to have discovered this hidden gem! The staff was friendly, the menu had a great selection, and the food was absolutely delicious. The prices were reasonable, making it a fantastic value for the quality of the dining experience. Can't wait to come back!"
